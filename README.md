# RVRoomBooking
A group project assignment for TEB1013: Structured Programming.

This project requires the team to come up with a case study, then identify and solve the problem of the case study using a programming concept that we have learnt during the semester.
Our team has came up with the problem of "Difficulty in checking room availability while booking a room in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS' Residential Village.
We have came up with a proposal for a system that allows student to check the room availability before booking, and we have chosen to use textfiles to complete the system.
